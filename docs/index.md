## WELCOME ##

Welcome to our project page for CS 175! Our program is to be able to complete masked images of specific biomes in minecraft. Previously, we completed a GAN (General Adversarial Network) that is able to generate new images of biomes based on its training data.

Here are some sample beach biome photos that we were able to generate from our GAN:

</p>

We now have a convolutional autoencoder that is able to complete masked images such as the ones below:
